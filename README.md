# zettelkasten-scrolls
An Obsidian Software Light Theme

![/screenshot.png]

This is a specialized minimal theme I created for developing a zettelkasten within Obsidian. It is designed to have all of the panels on the left hand side. In addition to that, there is no CSS created for the file explorer because I intended to only do file navigation through the search menu. 

**Notes**
* Haven't modified Graph View yet
* No use of file explorer
* All panels on left hand side of vault
* Wide Note Sizes
* Meant to be used with Andy Mode plugin set to non veritical stacks
* All headers display the /# in preview mode and are of the same size
